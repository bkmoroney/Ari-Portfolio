Image Sizes:

Home Page (Index):

    Header
        Width: Whatever you want! Currently 800px. You will need to update the 'width="800"' attribute in the html tag to the width of your image.
        Height: I recommend between 100-200px. Currently 150px.
    CTA Images
        Width: 250px
        Height: 250px

Illustration Page:

3 Column Lightbox Masonry Gallery
    Width: 600px
    Height: Can vary. To make a clean edge at the bottom, ensure heights in each column add up to the same number.

Flex Rows:
To calculate what sizes your images should be,
take the max screen width (1920) minus 20px for each gap, and divide accordingly. Round up

ie: 2/3 + 1/3 column:
1920-20 = 1900
1900/3 = 633.33333 & 1266.666666
